                Trucks and loaders are often used as the default materials
                handling options for underground mines as they are a well-known
                ‘safe’ technology. With mines looking towards future
                technologies, so much time and energy is being put into
                electrifying trucks and loaders but could there be a better way?
                When completing a materials handling trade-off study including
                ventilation, that considers all the options available, results
                show there is potential to save money, reduce costs and increase
                productivity.
                <br />
                <br />
                When performing a trade-off, the ventilation costs and reduced
                CO2 emissions should be considered to find the most
                cost-effective solution. Mining Plus has completed multiple
                materials handling trade-offs to compare the capital and
                operating costs for truck and loader, Railveyor, conveyor and
                shafts. While initially the truck and loader option may seem
                cheaper and more adaptable, incorporating primary ventilation
                costs often demonstrates that Railveyor, and occasionally
                conveyors, can be more cost-effective due to reduced operating
                costs and primary infrastructure associated with primary fans.
                Secondary ventilation savings and carbon modelling results
                further reinforce these cost advantages.
                <br />
                <br />
                By thoroughly exploring materials handling trade-offs and
                examining the long-term benefits of alternative materials
                handling technologies like Railveyor, mining operations can
                potentially unlock substantial cost savings, enhance
                environmental sustainability and make significant progress
                towards achieving net-zero emissions objectives.

              <h2 class="tt-g">Introduction</h2>
              <p class="txt-g">
                Underground mines traditionally rely on trucks and loaders for
                materials handling as they are well known, flexible and
                reliable. Mines are now looking towards future technologies
                largely focusing on electrifying trucks and bogger without
                considering investing in other existing technologies. The
                Railveyor system is often overlooked as a materials handling
                technology due to trade-offs not considering the additional
                savings from the reduction in ventilation requirements.
                Materials handling trade-off studies should consider primary
                ventilation costs at a minimum and the potential for greater
                savings with secondary ventilation modelling when using any
                electrified materials handling system.
                <br />
                <br />
                The materials handling trade-off study for the Gavião Project,
                owned by Almina and located in Portugal, is discussed as part of
                this paper to highlight the influence that ventilation has on
                the capital and operating costs of a mine. This study included
                diesel truck haulage, Railveyor and traditional belt conveyor.
                Due to the shallow depth of the mine and high capital costs,
                shaft haulage and locomotive methods of transport were excluded
                from this study. Battery-electric trucks and trolley-assist
                options were also not considered due to lack of availability and
                current restrictions of the technology.

                    The Railveyor is a conveyor rail hybrid system that can be
                    utilised as part of the main material handling system in
                    underground mines and on surface. It is not restricted by
                    belt lengths thus does not require expensive transfer
                    stations and additional excavations. The system is remotely
                    controlled and it has a series of two wheeled railcars,
                    Figure 1, making up a train. The train is driven by fixed
                    driving stations located along the track.
